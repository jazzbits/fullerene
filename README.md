# Fullerene Magic Sum Configurations

This repository  developed as part of my research on vertex integer assignments in carbon fullerenes. 
The goal is to discover configurations that produce a uniform “magic sum” across all faces, 
with implications for material engineering and structural analysis.

## 🔬 Research Summary

- Explores C24, C28, and other fullerene structures
- Uses constraint solvers to test sum invariance across pentagons and hexagons
- Visualizes valid configurations
- Manuscript submitted and under review
